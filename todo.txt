Short Term
    Write (better) README
    Check that variables with the same name have the same value
    $len:variable type
    Pattern database from file
    CLI
    More test coverage
        especially negative test cases
    Output rewritten binary

TODO
    Multiple number variables per instruction pattern
    Cleanup & improve error handling
    Accumulate a pattern database
        extract patterns from research papers
        collect patterns from Arxan sample
    Multi-Pass
        only the one kind of NOPs (the shortest) is allowed to be between each instruction pattern
        add a pattern which translates other kinds of NOP to the one kind

Future
    Benchmark & optimization
    Remove NOPs between instruction sequences in one basic block (consider jump chains)
        requires CFG so we don't destroy it
        binary -> CFG -> CFG without jump chains
    Arbitray constraints between variables (new optional section after pattern and replacement: constraints)
        e.g. $num:var1 + $num:var2 = $num:var3

paper note:
    mention keystone silently masking too large operand (lea rip, 64bit value)
    benchmarks
    currently only general purpose regs
    weakness: interleaved obfuscation patterns

// TODO:
//     - allow user to specify blacklist regions which may not be touched
//     - match pattern; verify variables are actually same content later; avoid pcre
//     - Some instructions have 64 bit immeditates/displacements
//     - how to handle SIB
//     - ignore NOPs when matching pattern (also add NOP patterns which get replaced with a normal NOP)
//     - determine basic blocks (only one entrace/leader) -> simplify jump chains ->
//     - match in these "real" basic blocks (make this a sub-pass)
//     - multi-pass

// NOTE:
//     - LOCK works as Keystone just emits the lock prefix which automatically gets recognized as a prefix for the next instruction

// FUTURE:
//     - pattern consisting of labeled blocks (for switches etc.)
//     - arbitrary NOPs (multiple ways to encode NOP?) between pattern instructions
//         - This will get resolved if we have NOP patterns and multi-pass deobfuscation
//     - Segmented memory addressing
//     - How to generically handle obfuscation which manually loads up e.g. AL,then AH ,and then uses EAX...

// DOCUMENTATION:
//     - Variable operands may not be negated in the pattern specifiation (e.g. `lea rbp, [rip - $num:var_name1]`)
//     - $num only supported for operand/displacement; not usable for e.g. scaled addressing
//     - retn replaced with ret (https://github.com/keystone-engine/keypatch/blob/master/keypatch.py#L541)
